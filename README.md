# Coursera:Introduction to Programming in C

## Overview

This repository is a comprehensive archive of my work from the [Coursera Introductory C Programming Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/c-programming). This specialization is designed to build a strong foundation in programming fundamentals for learners aiming to tackle complex problems through writing computer programs. The course curriculum covers the development of algorithms and the reading and writing of C code to implement them.

## Repository Contents
